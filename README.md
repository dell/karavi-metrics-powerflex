Karavi Metrics for PowerFlex is part of Karavi Observability storage enabler, which provides Kubernetes administrators standardized approaches for storage observability in Kuberenetes environments.

Karavi Metrics for PowerFlex is an open source distributed solution that provides insight into storage usage and performance as it relates to the CSI (Container Storage Interface) Driver for Dell EMC PowerFlex. This project provides the following metrics:

- **[Storage System I/O Performance Metrics](./docs/IO_PERFORMANCE.md)**: Visibility into the I/O performance of a storage system (IOPs, bandwidth, latency) broken down by Kubernetes node and volume.
- **[Storage Pool Consumption By CSI Driver](./docs/STORAGE_CAPACITY.md)**: Visibility into the total, used, and available capacity for a storage pool/storage class.

Karavi Metrics for PowerFlex captures telemetry data of storage usage and performance obtained through the CSI Driver for Dell EMC PowerFlex. The Metrics service then  pushes it to the OpenTelemetry Collector, so it can be processed, and exported in a format consumable by Prometheus. Prometheus can then be configured to scrape the OpenTelemetry Collector exporter endpoint to provide metrics so they can be visualized in Grafana. Please see [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/dell/karavi-observability/blob/main/docs/GETTING_STARTED_GUIDE.md) for information on requirements, deployment, and usage.

Once all prerequisites are on the Linux host, follow the steps below to clone and build the metrics service:

1. Clone the repository using the following command: `git clone https://github.com/dell/karavi-metrics-powerflex.git`
1. Set the DOCKER_REPO environment variable to point to the local Docker repository, for example: `export DOCKER_REPO=<ip-address>:<port>`
1. In the karavi-metrics-powerflex directory, run the following command to build the Docker image called karavi-metrics-powerflex: `make clean build docker`
1. Tag (with the "latest" tag) and push the image to the local Docker repository by running the following command: `make tag push`

__Note:__ Linux support only. If you are using a local insecure docker registry, ensure you configure the insecure registries on each of the Kubernetes worker nodes to allow access to the local docker repository.

## Testing Karavi Metrics for PowerFlex

From the root directory where the repo was cloned, the unit tests can be executed using the following command:

```console
make test
```

This will also provide code coverage statistics for the various Go packages.
