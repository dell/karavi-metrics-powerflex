Karavi Metrics for PowerFlex is an open source distributed solution that provides standardized approaches to gaining observability into Dell EMC products. This project provides the following metrics:

- **[I/O Performance Metrics](./docs/IO_PERFORMANCE.md)**: Visibility into the I/O performance of a storage system (IOPs, bandwidth, latency) broken down by export node and volume
- **[Storage Capacity Metrics](./docs/STORAGE_CAPACITY.md)**: Visibility into the total, used, and available capacity for a storage pool/storage class

Karavi Metrics for PowerFlex captures telemetry data about storage usage and performance and pushes it to the OpenTelemetry Collector, so it can be processed, and exported in a format consumable by Prometheus.  Prometheus can then be configured to scrape the OpenTelemetry Collector exporter endpoint to provide metrics so they can be visualized in Grafana. Please see [Getting Started Guide](./docs/GETTING_STARTED_GUIDE.md) for information on requirements, deployment, and usage.
