Karavi PowerFlex Metrics is an open source distributed solution that provides standardized approaches to gaining observability into Dell EMC products. Karavi PowerFlex Metrics provides the following metrics:
- **[I/O Performance Metrics](./docs/IO_PERFORMANCE.md)**: Visibility into the I/O performance of a storage system (IOPS, bandwidth, latency) broken down by export node and volume 
- **[Storage Capacity Metrics](./docs/STORAGE_CAPACITY.md)**: Visibility into the total, used, and available capacity for a storage pool/storage class

Karavi PowerFlex Metrics captures telemetry data about storage usage and performance and pushes it to the OpenTelemetry Collector so it can be processed, and exported in an open-source telemetry data format of your choice.  You can then configure an observability tool of your choice, such as Prometheus, to scrape the OpenTelemetry Collector exporter endpoint. Please see [Getting Started Guide](./docs/GETTING_STARTED_GUIDE.md) for information on requirements, deployment, and usage.
