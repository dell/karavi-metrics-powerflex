# Getting Started Guide

This document steps through the deployment and configuration of Karavi PowerFlex Metrics.

## Prerequisites

The following are prerequisites for building and deploying Karavi PowerFlex Metrics.

### Kubernetes

The following environment prerequisites are required for deploying karavi-powerflex-metrics.

A Kubernetes cluster with the appropriate version below is required for Karavi PowerFlex Metrics

| Version   | 
| --------- |
| 1.16-1.17 |

### Dell EMC Storage and CSI Driver

Karavi PowerFlex Metrics current has support for the following Dell EMC storage systems and associated CSI drivers.  One of the CSI drivers below must be deployed in the k8s cluster.  The k8s cluster must also have access to the associated storage system.

| Dell EMC Storge Product | CSI Driver |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| PowerFlex v3.0/3.5 | [CSI Driver for PowerFlex v1.1.5+](https://github.com/dell/csi-vxflexos) |

### OpenTelemetry Collector

[OpenTelemetry](https://blog.newrelic.com/product-news/what-is-opentelemetry/) standardizes how telemetry data can be collected and transferred to various open source observability tools. Karavi PowerFlex Metrics captures telemetry data and pushes it to the Open Telemetry Collector so it can be processed, and exported in an open-source telemetry data format of your choice. Simply point the observability tool of your choice, such as Prometheus, to scrape data from the Open Telemetry collector exporter endpoint. The OpenTelemetry service should be running on the same Kubernetes cluster as the karavi-powerflex-metrics service.

| Supported Version | Image                              | Helm Chart |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------- |
| 0.4.0             | otel/opentelemetry-collector:0.4.0 | N/A        |

The OpenTelemetry Collector must be configured with an exporter that is accessible at a specific URL. This URL will be scraped by the corresponding backend that has also been deployed. Example: If you have a Prometheus backend, you would configure the OpenTelmetry collector with a Prometheus exporter. In order to access the reference dashboards, you will need to configure the Prometheus OpenTelemetry exporter.

### Prometheus

The [Grafana metrics dashboards](../grafana/dashboards/powerflex) require Prometheus to scrape the metrics data from the Open Telemetry Collector. The Prometheus service should be running on the same Kubernetes cluster as the karavi-powerflex-metrics service.

| Supported Version | Image                   | Helm Chart                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2.19.2            | prom/prometheus:v2.19.2 | https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus |

**NOTE:** Version 2.19.2 has been qualified with Karavi PowerFlex Metrics but other versions may also work.

If you have the Prometheus OpenTelemetry collector exporter configured, you must configure Prometheus to scrape the endpoint.

#### Grafana

The [Grafana metrics dashboards](../grafana/dashboards/powerflex) require the following Grafana to be deployed in the same Kubernetes cluster as the karavi-powerflex-metrics service. You must also have Prometheus and the OpenTelemetry Collector deployed (see above).

| Supported Version | Image                 | Helm Chart                                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| v.7.1.0+          | grafana/grafana:7.1.0 | https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana |

- Grafana must be configured with the following data sources/plugins:

| Name                   | Additional Information                                                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prometheus data source | https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/features/datasources/prometheus/   |
| Data Table plugin      | https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/briangann-datatable-panel/installation |
| Pie Chart plugin       | https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/grafana-piechart-panel                 |

- Configure the Grafana Prometheus data source

| Setting | Value                     | Additional Information                          |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| Type    | prometheus                |                                                 |
| URL     | http://PROMETHEUS_IP:PORT | The IP/PORT of your running Prometheus instance |
| Access  | Proxy                     |                                                 |

Once all prerequisites are on the Linux host, follow the steps below to clone and build karavi-powerflex-metrics:

1. Clone the karavi-powerflex-metrics repository: `git clone https://github.com/dell/karavi-powerflex-metrics.git`
1. Set the DOCKER_REPO environment variable to point to the local Docker repository, example: `export DOCKER_REPO=<ip-address>:<port>`
1. In the karavi-powerflex-metrics directory, run the following to build the Docker image called karavi-powerflex-metrics: `make clean build docker`
1. To tag (with the "latest" tag) and push the image to the local Docker repository run the following: `make tag push`

__Note:__ If you are using a local insecure docker registry, ensure you configure the insecure registries on each of the Kubernetes worker nodes to allow access to the local docker repository

## Deploying Karavi PowerFlex Metrics
Karavi PowerFlex Metrics is deployed using Helm.  Usage information and available release versions can be found here: https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/karavi-powerflex-metrics.

If you built the Karavi PowerFlex Metrics Docker image and pushed it to a local registry, you can deploy it using the same Helm chart above.  You simply need to override the helm chart value pointing to where the Karavi PowerFlex Metrics image lives.  See https://github.com/dell/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/karavi-powerflex-metrics for more details.

## Testing Karavi PowerFlex Metrics

From the karavi-powerflex-metrics root directory where the repo was cloned, the unit tests can be exectued as follows:
```console
$ make test
```
This will also provide code coverage statistics for the various Go packages.
